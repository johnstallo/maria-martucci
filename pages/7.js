    <p>Finally, the war ended, but there remained much poverty. My father was a gardener and near the place where he worked there were the British who were helping Italy to recover from the losses of the war.</p>
    <p>At that time, however, my father was struck with malaria and could no longer work. We were six children, we began to lack everything, and my mother was forced to look for work. She applied at a local daycare as a helper or to prepare meals in the daycare center’s kitchen.</p>
    <p>At that time, we would buy groceries at a store whose owner was called Scalina. One day, events forced my mother to ask for store credit. She explained my father’s illness and promised to settle the debt as soon as possible. Scalina was very understanding, as she knew my mother’s situation well, and so she said: “Maria, don't worry, take everything your family needs, and you can pay me when your husband is well again.”</p>
    <p>It was a Saturday, and my mother then went to the daycare’s director, who had requested a meeting: “Maria, your application to work here has been accepted and you can start Monday. Tomorrow is Sunday,” the director continued, “and all those who begin work here must go to confession.” At that point my mother replied: “Director, you know well that I am an evangelical, and the Word of God teaches me that I must confess my sins only to God. I cannot confess my sins to a priest, because he is just a man, and not God.” When the director told her that this was the direct order of Don Antonio, my mother, who did not give up easily, gracefully asked: “Madam Director, may I talk to Don Antonio?” “Of course you may!” the director replied, but then she added, “However, Maria, I am disappointed that your little girl [Rosa Antonia, who attended the daycare] does not attend religious studies here.” My mother replied: “Indeed, Rosa Antonia does not know much of religion, but she certainly has a sound teaching of the Christian faith. Let's see if it's my daughter who doesn't know anything... can you call a Catholic girl, please?”</p>
    <p>The director called a girl and asked her: “Where is Jesus?” The girl looked up at the crucifix and said, “There He is!” My mother then said, “Now call my daughter.” The director called Rosa Antonia to her and asked the same question: “Where is Jesus?” Rosa Antonia replied, “Jesus is in heaven, on earth, and in my heart!”</p>
    <p>To this my mother was able to say, “Did you see? Your teachings say that Jesus is hanging on the wall, but our Jesus is Spirit and Truth, and is found everywhere.”</p>
    <p>After this episode, my mother, accompanied by the director and Aunt Nardina (my father’s sister), went to meet Don Antonio. You should bear in mind that both my mother and my aunt were illiterate. Entering the priest’s office, the director was the first to enter and said: “Good morning Don Antonio!” My aunt and mother also came in behind her, who said: “Peace Don Antonio. God says that when we enter someone's house we must greet them with peace. If those we have greeted are the children of peace, then peace will remain with them; if, on the contrary, they are not children of peace, then that peace will return to us and we must also shake the dust from our shoes, because not even the dust is worthy of the peace that we announce!” (See Matthew 10:12-15). <i>(Note: The Word of God says, more precisely, to announce the message of salvation in Christ wherever you are. The shaking of dust from the feet is but a way of emphasizing the sin of those who reject the gift of God. One day, the unbelieving will stand before Him. Then they will be required to explain, and they will be unable, why they did not welcome the disciples and, above all, Christ into their own hearts. See Luke 9:5; 10:3-11).</i></p>
    <p>The priest, on hearing this, while acknowledging that what my mother had said was scripturally sound, added: “Good, good... but as I have already told the director, Sunday you will need to confess and take communion. By doing so, you may start work on Monday.” My mother, who along with her sister-in-law, had already shown themselves to the priest to be illiterate, replied decisively: “Don Antonio, do you have the Bible and do not know what is written? Cursed is the man who confesses to man and blessed is the man who confesses to God, because he will obtain mercy.” (See Jeremiah 17:5-7)</p>
    <p><i>(Note: The Bible verses cited by Maria refer in particular to the trust that men place in men rather than in God. Other biblical passages that refer more specifically to the confession of sins and to only trust in Christ for the remission of sins are the following: </i></p>
    <p><i>Hebrews 4:16 states how we can directly approach God with confidence, because of the sacrifice of Christ;</i></p>
    <p><i>Hebrews 4:14-15; 10:21 explains how Jesus is our only High Priest;</i></p>
    <p><i>1 John 1:9 states that when we confess our sins, He – and nobody else – is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us of all unrighteousness.</i></p>
    <p><i>When James 5:16 mentions that we are to confess our sins one to another, it does not mean confessing to a human in the priestly role, but more simply that it is right and necessary to ask our neighbor for forgiveness if we have offended or wronged them. The verse, in fact, continues by encouraging believers to pray for each other and, moreover, does not refer in any way to the remission of sins.)</i></p>
    <p>They quoted several other Bible passages, so much so that the priest exclaimed, “You are a liar! You said that you and your sister-in-law cannot read but, if so, how do you know so many verses?” My mother replied: “Don Antonio, I am sorry that you are a priest and you do not know that the Bible says: <span>‘And when they bring you to trial and deliver you over, do not be anxious beforehand what you are to say, but say whatever is given you in that hour, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.’</span>” <span>(Mark 13:11; Matthew 10:19)</span>. After this exchange of words, the priest felt that he had lost the battle and, angry, sent them away.</p>
    <p>“If you want to work you will have to go to confession!” he added. My mother retorted, “I have no intention of going to confession, God will provide!” My mother and aunt went away not feeling demoralized but edified and fortified for the way the Lord had guided them.</p>
    <p>That Sunday morning, the priest told his parishioners during mass: “Listen and pay attention, what I am about to say is very important! In via Maroncelli no. 7 lives a certain Maria Martucci, she has six children and a husband sick with malaria who cannot work.</p>
    <p>This woman has been excommunicated; do not even pass by her house. I say this because she was offered a job at the child daycare’s kitchen and she refused it, because she did not want to confess before starting work, saying that she only confesses to her God. Be careful, therefore, even to pass by that road.”</p>
    <p>The following Monday, Scalina sent for my mother in the early morning: “Listen Maria, until now I have given you credit at my store, but now I cannot do it any longer and I want you to pay the full balance of your account; I'm sorry say, you had the opportunity to work at the daycare you applied, but you refused it so as not to go to confession. So I want you to pay what you owe now.” Scalina felt defrauded and probably also fearful of the priest and his words.</p>
    <p>“Listen Scalina,” my mother said “that job was very important to me, because I really need it. I refused it because the Lord says that we must trust only in Christ for the forgiveness of sins, because only He can forgive and remove them completely before God. That priest is only a man and he cannot do that. God did not give him this power and this role.” (See I John 1:9; Psalm 32:5) She continued, “Don't you worry, the Lord in whom I trust will help me and I will pay back my debt to the very last penny.”</p>
    <p>My mother was strong, but she was also a sensitive woman and, in that moment, also fragile, due to my father's illness and our state of poverty. She returned home and, weeping, knelt before God and put everything before Him. She asked Him to resolve her situation and, above all, that His name would not be tarnished. As she cried, she saw a man seated at a small table with her and a church brother, Francesco Giancaspero.</p>
    <p>The seated man wrote something on a piece of paper, gave it to brother Giancaspero and then said, “Go in peace.” My mother seemed to have had a vision, and she later told this to her sister-in-law, also recounting what had happened with the grocery store owner.</p>
    <p>My aunt said, “Perhaps God wants you to visit brother Giancaspero, but I cannot tell you why nor what the Lord will do.”</p>
    <p>The next day, my mother and my aunt went to visit a dear sister of Taranto, sister D’amico, and told her everything that had happened the previous day. My mother also described the vision she had in prayer, confiding also that she was uncertain what the Lord wanted her to know. After listening, the sister also gave her opinion: “The Lord sends you to brother Giancaspero!” At that statement my mother said, “How can I go to Triggiano if I don't even have the money for a ticket?” The sister immediately said, “Don't worry, I must give you money and you must go.” <i>(Note: A person born and raised speaking Tarantino would understand well the sense of the sister's expressions. The use of the expression must – I must give it you – indicates on the one hand the obligation that the sister sensed in her heart, and on the other, that of Maria to obey the voice of the Lord. The sister D’amico, in other words, meant: “Don't worry, I'm here to lend you a hand, because I am ‘obliged’ by what I feel in my heart from God. I’ll pay for your ticket. You, on your part, must obey the Lord and do not worry about anything else: go where He sends you.)</i></p>
    <p>The next day, my mother went to Triggiano, but when she arrived at brother Giancaspero’s house, his wife told her that he would be away for a few days. However, his wife, who was very kind, added heartily: “Tonight we have church service. Come with us, for no doubt the brethren will be glad to see you.”</p>

    <p>During the service, the presiding brother gave the believers an opportunity to testify and particularly encouraged my mother to do so: “Tonight among us is sister Maria, who has come from Massafra, who will tell us in person how the Lord miraculously healed her son.” (Many had come to know of that extraordinary event, but not everyone knew my mother.) My mother then gave her testimony, how Jesus had saved her, how she had been persecuted, and how the Lord had healed Gino.</p>
    <p>That evening, the Lord greatly blessed that church service. The believers, who had been touched by that testimony and who were sensitive to the voice of the Lord, discreetly and thoughtfully placed money in my mother’s hands when they greeted her, as much as they were able. My mother, filled with gratitude not only to the Lord but also to these dear believers, could not help but reveal the reason for that visit. In fact, in her testimony, she had not mentioned anything about the events that had compelled her to reach Triggiano. All the believers, then, began to encourage her: “Sister, you must go to Modugno to find brother Giancaspero!” A sister even offered to accompany her, feeling constrained in her heart by God.</p>
    <p>Whoever had the opportunity to meet brother Giancaspero knows that everyone in Puglia knew him. He was always called to help resolve problems anytime they arose in the churches. He was indeed a very dear brother, led by the Lord and ready to serve Him in everything.</p>
    <p>The next morning, my mother was accompanied to Modugno to the home of brother Sabino, the pastor of that community. “Sister Maria, what are you doing in Modugno?” asked brother Giancaspero. She told him the full story: the offered job, the priest, the shopkeeper and the vision.</p>
    <p>After the brother had heard everything, he said to her: “Tonight there will be a church meeting here in Modugno. Come with us and then we'll see what there is to do.” That evening during the church service, she was bidden by the pastor to share her testimony and she, with great joy in her heart, spoke of all that the Lord had done in our house and many other situations in which the Lord had helped her.</p>
    <p>After her testimony, the entire congregation was blessed by the Lord as they rejoiced in all the wonderful things He had done.</p>
    <p>When the service ended, the believers gathered together a generous offering for my mother, adding to the sum of money many food items as well. My mother thanked the Lord and the community, and said to brother Giancaspero: “Now it is good for you to accompany me to Massafra and also to Mrs. Scalina, the shopkeeper.”</p>
    <p>The next day they arrived in Massafra, and together they went to Scalina’s shop, and asked for the total amount owing. Scalina lost no time and said, “I've already calculated the bill. The total is forty thousand lire.” It was the year 1948/1949, and that was a lot of money! My mother counted out the money and handed it to her. The shopkeeper lifted her head and exclaimed, “But Maria! You are paying me everything!” My mother replied, “Didn't I tell you that the Lord I serve and trust would provide me with everything I needed so that I could repay you to the last penny? So, the Lord has done so and I have come to pay my debt.”</p>
    <p>And so, once again, my mother shared with her about Jesus and the love He has for those who love Him, who fear Him and who confess their sin only to Him!</p>
    <p>The shopkeeper, still astounded, said, “Maria, do not hesitate to come here when you need anything, because now I know that your God is great.” My mother said to her: “You would love my God too, if one day you came to know Him and trusted Him in Spirit and Truth.”</p>
