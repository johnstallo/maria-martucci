    <p>Two years passed in this circumstance of suffering and persecution. One cold night, my mother heard a voice calling her saying, “Maria, arise and invoke my name, and I will give you grace.” She obeyed and arose from bed, even though it was very cold: her heart was filled with the warmth of the Holy Spirit; she kneelt beside the cradle of her child and she began to pray to the Lord with all her heart. She entreated God saying, “Lord, you have called me and you have told me to invoke your name and that you will give me grace. I pray, oh Lord! Operate tonight, and make yourself known to those who do not know you! You are the True God, Living and True, the King of Kings, Doctor of doctors, do as you will, take me out of this ordeal, Lord, I pray. Restore my son, let him come back as before, or take him with you!” As she prayed and cried, my father barked, “Stop it! Even at night do you go to pray to the devil?”</p>
    <p>Instead of stopping, however, she implored the Holy name of the Lord with even greater intensity; and while she prayed she heard a noise from the cradle of the child: it was a noise similar to that of a piece of wood that snaps, followed immediately by a strong cry of pain from the child. My mother, with her eyes still closed in prayer, thanked the Lord. She was certain that God had performed His work. She got up and looked down at the cradle, and she saw her son perfectly healthy, just as he was before his sickness. With great joy she took him in her arms, and hurried to my father and exclaimed, “Look at what great miracle the Lord has done tonight!” My father was so shocked he could no longer speak. Glory to the name of our great God!</p>
    <p>My mother then wrapped the child in a blanket and went outside the home; she knocked on the doors of her neighbors, crying out, “Open up! Come and see the great miracle the Lord has done!” Her neighbors, before opening, thought: “Poor Mary: from when her son fell sick she has become completely insane!”</p>
    <p>Yet, taken by curiosity, the neighbors opened their doors one by one, and they saw how, indeed, the Jesus they had often mocked had now that night wrought a great miracle! Glory to God, because He is the True and Living God!</p>
    <p>That night, my mom made a vow to the Lord, saying, “From now on, for any disease that may strike my body, you will be my Doctor and my medicine.”</p>
    <p>That day, not only did God heal the child, He also saved my father from the sickness of sin as well as most of our relatives. The Lord also saved many fromof the neighborhood, and by His grace, the conversion of souls did not stop there but He continued still for a long time. Just as the Lord worked through the apostles when they were persecuted the more (Acts 19:20), my mother also was strengthened in faith the more she was insulted and marginalized. The glory of all this goes to God, who in such adverse circumstances saved and baptized souls with the Holy Spirit.</p>
