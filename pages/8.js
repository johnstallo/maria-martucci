    <p>My mother was a trumpet and a waving flag at Massafra: The whole town knew her as Maria the Evangelist.</p>
    <p>She was the trumpet announcing the love of God, the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross, and the blood He shed for the salvation of all mankind.</p>
    <p>Through her testimony, the church grew day by day. In the 1950s, brother Antonio Santoro began to visit from Taranto, preaching the Word of God to the believers of Massafra. Brother Andrisani and Giancaspero tasked my father to open and close the service, because brother Santoro often, before reaching us, had also preached in Taranto and could not guarantee arriving on time. Dad, however, was still smoking. He had asked the Lord for the strength to quit his habit but, until then, he had not succeeded.</p>
    <p>One morning, my mother woke up and as usual she knelt to pray and thank the Lord for the rest He had given her during the night. As she prayed, she heard a voice calling her: “Maria!” It was the voice she had heard three years before. The voice told her to remove the contaminated things from her house. My mother asked the Lord what was contaminated, but no voice answered. She ended her prayer while she still thought, “What is there that is contaminated? Help me understand, Lord.” While she was lost in thought, my Aunt Lucia arrived, to whom my mother said: “You know Lucia, that voice I heard almost three years ago called me again and told me to remove contaminated things from my home, but it did not tell me what I have to remove. Let us pray together and see if the Lord tells me what I must do!” As they prayed and cried, my mother contemplated: “Lord, You called me, now please tell me what to do and what is contaminated in this house. What should I take away? Because, Lord, I don't know what I must do! I am sure it was You who spoke to me.” And the voice answered her saying, “The tobacco!”</p>
    <p>My father had bought 500 grams of tobacco leaves from one of my mother’s brothers, who cultivated them on behalf of a “master” of Palagiano. My father would shred the tobacco, put it in cigarette paper, and smoke it.</p>
    <p>At that very moment my mother, aided by my aunt, took the tobacco and put it in a cloth, tied it, made a hole and buried it. After doing all this, they cleaned the whole house together, searching even in the pockets of Dad's jackets, and disinfected everywhere so that the smell of tobacco completely disappeared.</p>
    <p>At that point, there knocked on the door two customs officers, saying: “Does Mr. Cosimo Stallo live here?” To the affirmative response of my mother the agents no longer said a word. They entered and began to rummage throughout the house, even removing the bed sheets to check the mattresses. After they had sifted every corner, they looked at each other and said, “There’s not even a trace of what we were looking for,” and so they left.</p>
    <p>As they went away, my father arrived carrying firewood on his bicycle; when he saw the customs officers, he threw the firewood to the ground and thought, “They will now arrest me!”</p>
    <p>My mother told him everything that had happened and said, “There is no need to worry, see how great our God is? The Lord knows that we have not stolen anything from anyone.” So that day Dad said, “Lord, you freed me from prison and from this day onward I no longer want to smoke!” He burned the tobacco and kept his promise to the Lord until He called him to Himself. Glory to God.</p>
    <p>And thus, after so many years that my father had asked the Lord for the strength to stop, God had worked in this way.</p>
    <p>Not even a month went by, the “master” of the tobacco plantation where my uncle worked arrived riding a cart and horse. The man apologized to my parents saying, “I had doubted you and even Pietro (my uncle). I thought you were selling smuggled tobacco, and that's why I sent the customs officers your way. Pietro told me that he had sold you 500 grams of tobacco, but I did not trust him. I have come to apologize, and I brought you many things to eat: legumes, almonds, dried figs and many other things. When my father put all the pieces of that story together, the picture became clear, and he said, “I am the one who is to thank you, because if the customs officers hadn't come, I would never have quit smoking!” Having said that, he, like my mother, could not keep his lips closed, and shared the Gospel with that man. Glory to God!</p>
