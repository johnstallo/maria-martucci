    <p>In the house where we lived there was a courtyard with a small chicken coop.</p>
    <p>One day, Dad eyed a hen as it died. He told my mother, “Use this hen for the meat sauce tomorrow. And also prepare Orecchiette pasta.” He was very desirous of that hen, especially in that time of absolute poverty, and he licked his lips at the very thought of a good dish of meat ragù. My mom said, “I don't want the meat sauce, I’ll have the orecchiette with ricotta.”</p>
    <p>The next day, she prepared the chicken with the meat sauce, and the orecchiette with the ricotta for her.</p>
    <p>When everything was on the table, Dad, instigated by the enemy, said, “All right! Eat the orecchiette with the ricotta, but after you will eat the meat as well!” Mom said, “No, I won’t eat it. I can't eat the hen we raised!” My father cussed and went on to say, “You won’t eat it because the <i>evangelists</i> don't eat the flesh of dead animals?” (Even today many do not know the difference between the two words “evangelist” and “evangelical”). My father was certain that my mother did not want to eat the hen in order to obey some rule of her new religion, and so he tried to provoke her.</p>
    <p>“Well,” said my mother, “it is so. It is written in the Bible not to eat blood, nor strangled meat, because its life is its blood.” (see Acts 15:29).</p>
    <p>Dad became enraged at those words, and he picked up the bowl full of pasta and threw it to the ground, breaking it. He then left infuriated.</p>
    <p>My mother, with much patience, cleaned it all up, threw away the pasta and told us children: “Come, let’s pray that the Lord may forgive him and save him.”</p>
    <p>However, we were hungry. “Come to the table and eat the meat!” she beckoned us. But because we paid attention to everything that Mom and Dad said, we replied, “Mom, but isn't it written in the Bible not to eat strangled meat?”</p>
    <p>To that question she answered, “You are right my children! I will give you something else to eat.”</p>
    <p>My father returned late that night when we children had already gone to bed.</p>
    <p>He placed on the table a parcel wrapped up in paper, and my mother, acting as if nothing had happened, opened it and saw raw liver (it was the first time he had brought raw liver, as other times he had brought it precooked from the store).</p>
    <p>My mother asked, “Cosimo, how would you like me to prepare this? Fried or roasted?”  To which he answered, “As you wish, I don't care.” He picked up an empty bottle and went to get some wine.</p>
    <p>My mother, with the patience and strength that the Lord gave her, said to herself: “I will prepare one half of the liver fried, and the other half I'll roast, to avoid any argument.” She made a fire (there were no ovens in the house in those times) and prepared the meat. In the meantime, my father returned, saying: “Wake up the children: they must eat with us.” And so, we all ate in peace, and there was no quarrel.</p>
    <p>After a few days, my father confessed to my mother: “You know more than the devil, because when I brought the raw liver the other night, instead of being angry about what happened at lunch, you prepared it anyway. I, on the other hand, expected you not to cook it and I was ready to give you a thrashing!!! Instead, you behaved well, as always.” On this point my mom said: “It was not I who behaved well, but it was thanks to that Jesus in whom I believe and that you, instead, mistreat!”</p>
    <p><i>[Note: My mother acted in good conscience before God, refusing to eat the flesh of the hen that had died without first having been slaughtered. She was sincere when she said she did not want to eat the hen she had raised, but at the same time she knew that eating a dead animal in that way offended the Lord and His law. The Bible, in fact, clearly states the prohibition of drinking or eating the blood of animals. (Leviticus 17:14, Acts 15:29)]</i></p>
