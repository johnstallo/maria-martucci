    <p>At around 90 years old, my mother developed a stomach ulcer and began to feel unwell. The family doctor told her that if she wanted to live, she would need surgery; otherwise, she would suffer and eventually die. My mother responded to the doctor with these words: “Doctor, I have been serving the Lord for many years, and perhaps the time has come for me to go home to Him! I want to keep the vow I made to God so many years ago until my death, because the Lord says: <BibleQuote>‘Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.’</BibleQuote>” (See Revelation 2:10). “Doctor, I want the crown that the Lord has promised me!”</p>
    <p>The doctor was so taken aback that he stopped trying to convince her.</p>
