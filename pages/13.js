    <p>My mother, as I have said already, was illiterate, but I can say that in her head there seemed to be a recorder, because when she spoke of the Gospel, she remembered many verses of the Bible, giving a faithful testimony of the work of the Holy Spirit in her. In the Bible, in fact, it is written: <BibleQuote>“for the Holy Spirit will teach you in that very hour what you ought to say” (Luke 12:12; Matthew 10:19)</BibleQuote>. My mother never wasted an opportunity to speak of God to others, and through her many people came to the knowledge of the Truth, and accepted Christ into their heart as their personal Savior. That's why everyone in our town knew her as Maria the Evangelist.</p>
    <p>I remember once, when she was in her later years, a family moved in to live on the same apartment landing as hers. Their front doors faced each other, but she never had the opportunity to speak to the new family about the Lord! She prayed to God, saying, “Lord, give me the opportunity to talk about You to this family.”</p>
    <p>One day, she decided to play her tape recorder in the light well that shared a wall with the apartment next door. She wanted to listen to hymns and, she also hoped at the same time to arouse the curiosity of her neighbor. She also played some cassettes of sermon recordings of the Word of God and raised the volume a little, so that the neighbor would also hear it.</p>
    <p>But time passed and nothing happened. She did the same thing for several more days when, finally, my mother and the new neighbor chanced on each other on the landing. The lady greeted her and said, “Ma'am, those cassettes you listen to are very beautiful!” My mother replied saying, “Those cassettes speak of Jesus, including the songs. I am a believer of the evangelical faith.” The lady went on and said, “I would like to listen more closely, but my mother, who is somewhat old, is against it, because she says that your group of people are wicked. However, I like listening to those words.”</p>
    <p>My mother replied that she would gladly talk to her mother, despite her neighbor warning her of the risk of being rudely sent away. “Don't worry,” replied my mother with her usual sweet insistence, “let me know when she arrives, and I will come. Let's see what happens.”</p>
    <p>So came the day when the two met. My mother presented herself at the door of Titina (the name of the young lady) and asked if she had some onion. Titina beckoned her to come and sit in the kitchen, where her mother was sitting. “Who is this lovely lady?” said my mother. Titina replied, “This is my mother, do you see how beautiful she is?” The lady, then, said: “I am only an old woman, full of ailments.” “But,” said my mother, “the Lord keeps you young!” So one word led to another, and my mother soon began to share the Gospel. The elderly lady listened and at one point said: “What you speak of is very nice to hear, but it is purported that the evangelicals are not good people, and that in their church they speak ill of all the saints. They also say that you are excommunicated.”</p>
    <p>At those words, my mother said, “Why don't you come to church with us one evening, so you can listen for yourself what is said?” The lady replied, “I can't, I am unable to walk even.” My mother went on to say, “Don't worry, we'll take you with the car.” The lady then agreed, saying that she would only come out of curiosity. So at the first opportunity, both mother and daughter took a ride with my mother and my brother Donato and went to church together. At the end of the service, Titina and her mother said, “People speak so badly about evangelicals, but we saw nothing wrong with what you do. On the contrary, we liked it so much that we would like to come with you always.” From that day, not only did the two of them give their hearts to the Lord, but also Titina’s husband and their young son, Mimmo. All were saved and baptized according to the command of Jesus: <BibleQuote>“Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 28:19).</BibleQuote> The glory goes to God, for all the wonderful things He accomplishes!</p>
