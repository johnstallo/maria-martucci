<p>Maria Martucci, my mother, was born on September 16, 1909, in Mottola, a town in the province of Taranto, to Donato Martucci and Rosa Antonia Lattarulo. She came from a large family. Her mother was a seamstress who worked from home, and as the eldest daughter, Maria was responsible for the household chores and caring for her younger siblings. She carried out these duties with dedication and joy.</p>
    
    <p>At 19, Maria became engaged to my father, Cosimo Stallo, who was born on November 2, 1905, in Massafra to Giovanni Stallo and Maria Annunziata Mellone. He came from a poor family. My paternal grandmother was widowed when my father was only 17 years old; my grandfather was struck by a train while on his way to work with a cart, and he died.</p>
    
    <p>After this tragic event, my father took on the role and responsibilities of the head of the family, caring for his home and his four sisters: Antonia, Lucia, Leonarda, and Pompea.</p>
    
    <p>When my mother was 20 years old, on November 10, 1929, my parents married and settled in Mottola.</p>

    <p>They had three children in the early years of their marriage: a girl and two boys. Sadly, an infectious disease struck the family, claiming the lives of their first two children. After this profound loss, my parents decided to move to my father's hometown of Massafra in 1936, along with their youngest child, Giovanni, who was about two years old at the time.</p>
