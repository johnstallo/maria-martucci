    nextTitle="Introduction">

    <p>I was born in Massafra on February 20, 1940. It was the time of war and I grew up in poverty.</p>
    <p>We were six children in my family, and since my mother had already converted to the Gospel, I was raised with sound Christian teachings. My mother tried to instill in us, primarily by her example, the love and fear of God who has done so much for sinful man.</p>
    <p>My mother faced every problem with a simple faith in God, and every day we witnessed the Lord actively working in our home, in things both great and small.</p>
    <p>It caused a love to grow in my heart for this amazing Lord who died on the cross even for me and saved me from eternal death.</p>
    <p>I am deeply thankful to Him for being at my side throughout my life. Together with my husband, Salvatore Convertino, we have served our God in humility and simplicity in all that He has given us to do. We have had many moments of joy, and some unpleasant, but we can never be sufficiently grateful for the blessings that He has faithfully gifted to our lives.</p>
    <p>I am now 76 years of age, and about ten years ago a deep desire began to grow in my heart to write down the simple but genuine testimony of my mother; a woman who, even though illiterate, was driven by a strong zeal for her “beloved Savior” (so she called God), and being filled with the Holy Spirit she testified of God with words and by example until her very last breath.</p>
    <p>I have prayed earnestly for the Lord to guide me to write this small booklet, in order to make known to a new generation the faithful dedication of this woman’s service to the Lord, and how He used her for the salvation of many souls.</p>
    <p>May the Lord of Glory continue to save men and women in this generation.</p>
