    <p>One day my mother felt bloated and could not urinate. My father called the doctor to understand what was wrong and the diagnosis was nephritis. My mother’s abdomen was swollen like a balloon, and the doctor recommended that she immediately should be admitted to hospital because she ran the risk of dying. She, of course, refused admission, whereas my father tried to convince her to go for fear of losing her. My mother then said to him, “I made a vow with the Lord and I want to keep it. If I live or die, let His will be done in me.” My father, however, disagreed and went to find someone to give him a ride to take her to the hospital.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, she pleaded with God with all her heart: “Lord, You must work at this moment, stretch out Your hand over me and heal me from this illness. Otherwise the car will come and they will take me by force to the hospital, and what will become of Your testimony? Lord, let Yourself be known once again, You are my Doctor and my medicine.” As she prayed, she felt the urge to go to the bathroom. She gently and slowly eased herself down from off the bed and with God's help she reached the bathroom. By His grace, she came out completely emptied and no longer swollen.</p>
    <p>When my father returned with a car to go to the hospital, he saw my mother and asked, “What happened?” And she answered: “And what do you think!? That the Lord abandons those who trust in Him? He is righteous and does not leave adrift those who go to Him by faith.”</p>
    <p>Whenever my mother was sick, she always agreed for the doctor to be called, because then her illness would be diagnosed and she was sure the Lord would perform His work. Thus she could testify regarding which illness the Lord had healed her from. The reason for her joy, however, was not to boast of this, but to seize the opportunity to testify of the greatness of Jesus and of His love that heals and saves from all evil.</p>
