    <p>One day my mother felt bloated and could not urinate. My father called the doctor to understand what was wrong and the diagnosis was nephritis. My mother’s abdomen was swollen like a balloon, and she immediately had to be admitted to hospital because she ran the risk of dying. She, of course, refused admission, whereas my father tried to convince her to go for fear of losing her. My mother then said to him, “I made a vow with the Lord and I want to keep it. If I live or die, let His will be done in me.” My father, however, disagreed and went to find someone to give him a ride to take her to the hospital. In the meantime, she pleaded with God with all her heart: “Lord, You must work at this moment, stretch out Your hand over me and heal me from this illness. Otherwise the car will come and they will take me by force to the hospital. And what will happen to Your testimony? Lord, let Yourself be known once again, You are my Doctor and my medicine.” As she prayed, she felt the urge to go to the bathroom. She let herself down slowly from the bed and with God's help she reached the bathroom. By His grace, she came out completely emptied and no longer swollen. When my father returned with a car to go to the hospital, he saw my mother and asked, “What happened?” And she answered: “And what do you think? That the Lord abandons those who trust in Him? He is righteous and does not leave adrift those who go to Him by faith.” Whenever my mother was sick, she was always was content to call the doctor, because her illness would be diagnosed and she was sure the Lord would perform His work. The reason for the joy, however, was not to boast of this, but to seize the opportunity to testify of the greatness of Jesus and His love that heals and saves from all evil.</p>
