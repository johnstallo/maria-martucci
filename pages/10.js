    <p>One day, my mother felt bloated and couldn’t urinate. My father called the doctor to find out what was wrong, and the diagnosis was nephritis. My mother was swollen like a balloon, and the doctor insisted that she be admitted to the hospital immediately, as she was at risk of dying. She, however, refused to be admitted, while my father tried to persuade her out of fear of losing her. My mother then said to him, “I made a vow to the Lord, and I intend to keep it. Whether I live or die, let His will be done in me.” My father, still concerned, went to find someone to give him a ride to take her to the hospital.</p>
    <p>In the meantime, she pleaded with God with all her heart: “Lord, You must act right now; stretch out Your hand over me and heal me from this illness. Otherwise, the car will come, and they will take me by force to the hospital, and what will happen to Your testimony? Lord, reveal Yourself once again; You are my Doctor and my medicine.” As she prayed, she felt the urge to go to the bathroom. She slowly and carefully got out of bed, and with God's help, made her way to the bathroom. By His grace, she came out completely relieved and no longer swollen.</p>
    <p>When my father returned with a car to take her to the hospital, he saw my mother and asked, “What happened?” And she replied, “And what do you think? That the Lord abandons those who trust in Him? He is righteous and does not leave adrift those who come to Him in faith.”</p>
    <p>Whenever my mother was sick, she was always glad to have the doctor called, because once her illness was diagnosed, she was certain that the Lord would act. This way, she could testify about the illness from which the Lord had healed her. However, her joy was not in boasting about the healing itself, but in seizing the opportunity to testify about the greatness of Jesus and His love, which heals and saves from all evil.</p>
