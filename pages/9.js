    <p>During the course of her life, my mother became ill many times: I want to touch on this as well, to give glory to God for all the times in which my mother was healed, who had promised to make Him her doctor and her medicine.</p>
    <p>She had so much faith in the vow she had made to the Lord on the day of Gino's healing.</p>
    <p>One Sunday morning, after the church service that was held in our house, my mother started to feel sick; she began to vomit, and we fetched her a basin. I was eleven years old. My mother filled that basin with blood. Dad quickly called the family doctor, who already knew all about my mother's testimony. He ordered her to bed, not to take cold and to go get x-rays of her chest and shoulder the very next day, because it seemed to him a bad disease.</p>
    <p>The next day, Mom went to get her x-rays done and the diagnosis was clear: tuberculosis. The doctor wanted her hospitalized, but she said, “Doctor, you know the vow I made to the Lord.” But the doctor insisted, knowing well the care that a patient with tuberculosis needs. “The Lord is mighty and can heal me, for He is my Doctor, and my medicine!” said my mother, decidedly.</p>
    <p>The days went by and she was bedridden and weak. In that situation, however, instead of worrying about her state of health, she prayed to the Lord for the Holy Spirit to descend on my Aunt Lucia's house, where the brethren met to pray. And as she prayed, she saw a young man dressed in white, who laid his hand behind her shoulder and on her chest and said: “Arise, go and pray with them!” In that very moment she felt stronger; she arose, dressed and went to my aunt's house, where the believers were praying.</p>
    <p>She silently entered into the house, trying not to be noticed. She had yet another vision: a cloud of blood covered the faithful and a kind of luminous sphere moved in the middle of the cloud. She knelt down and, unable to restrain herself, exclaimed: “Brothers and sisters, seek the Lord with all your heart because this morning He will baptize with the Holy Spirit.”</p>
    <p>And indeed, that morning, the Holy Spirit descended among them as on the day of Pentecost: many of the believers began to speak in other languages and were baptized with the Holy Spirit!</p>
    <p>There was then a great revival in the church of Massafra. Word spread to Mottola of the many blessings that God was bestowing to the believers. There was a great revival in the whole area; the Lord saved, healed and baptized in the Holy Spirit. Glory to God for the great work He accomplishes!</p>
    <p>A few days later, my mother went back to the doctor and said, “Doctor, I want to take x-rays of my lungs again.” The doctor replied that it was too early to redo the x-rays; so my mother decided to tell him everything that had happened. The doctor, amazed, consented to request for another set of x-rays. My mother then went back to Taranto, bringing with her the previous x-rays that showed signs of tuberculosis. After taking the x-rays a second time, the doctor wanted to see her and with great amazement said: “Ma'am, who told you that you have tuberculosis?” My mother said, “You yourself, doctor, diagnosed me with that disease,” and she showed him the old x-rays. The doctor, when he saw them, was even more amazed than before; he looked at her and said, “Madam you have had a great miracle!” To this statement my mother said: “Yes doctor, you said well, it is a great miracle! Yes, this really happened!” and she told the doctor how she had been healed and how the Lord had laid His hand on her chest and behind her shoulder; she also told him of the vow she had made with God and of the faith which she had placed in Him!</p>
    <p>When my mother would talk about these things, she never neglected to state in a clear and simple way the Gospel of salvation in Christ. It is so for all those who believe in Him, they cannot be silent. Even that doctor of Taranto, therefore, learned of the great wonders that God does for all those who trust in the Lord in Spirit and in Truth.</p>
