    <p>Throughout her life, my mother's experiences with the Lord became known in many areas of Italy and even abroad, reaching as far as Australia, where my brother Antonio had gone as a missionary in the 1970s.</p>
    <p>The miracles she received and her faithfulness to the vow she made to the Lord were shared everywhere. She was always a blessing wherever she went, and she was often asked to testify about the great works that God had accomplished in her life and in her family. She was over ninety years old when she went to Australia for the last time. With heartfelt joy, she seized every opportunity to give all the glory to God, always emphasizing the Lord's love and goodness toward her and all humanity.</p>
    <p>In the final period of her life, my mother would say to her children: “When the Lord calls me, I urge you to always remain faithful to Him and not to weep for me, for I am going to meet the Lord, my beloved Savior. Instead of grieving over my absence, think of me seated at the table of the great King with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the saints—both those I knew and those I will come to know. We shall all sit at the table and rejoice for all eternity.”</p>
    <p>In the very last days of her life, one of my sons-in-law went to visit her. By that time, she was bedridden and could hardly speak, but in a soft voice, she said to him: “My son, how many times have you been told about Jesus? Think about it—when He died on the cross, they placed a crown of thorns on His head; He did this for us sinners! But if we are faithful to Him, He will give us a crown of gold!”</p>
    <p>Two days later, at the age of 95, the Lord called her to Him, and she was able to say: <BibleQuote>“I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Henceforth, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved His appearing.” (2 Timothy 4:7, 8)</BibleQuote></p>
