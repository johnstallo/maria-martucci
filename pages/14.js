    <p>Throughout her life, my mother's experiences with the Lord had come to be known throughout many areas of Italy and abroad, even to Australia where my brother Antonio had gone as a missionary since the 1970s.</p>
    <p>The miracles she had received and her faithfulness to the pledge she had made to the Lord were retold everywhere. She was always a blessing in every place she went, and she was often asked to testify of the great works that God had accomplished in her life and in her family. She was over ninety years old when she went to Australia for the last time. With passionate joy, she took advantage of every opportunity to give all the glory to God, emphasizing the Lord's love and goodness toward her and all humanity.</p>
    <p>In the last period of her life, my mother would tell her children: “When the Lord calls me, I commend you to always be faithful to Him and to not weep for me, for I am going to meet the Lord, my beloved Savior. Instead of suffering for my absence, think that I will be seated at the table of the great King with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and all the saints, both those I knew and those I will know. We shall all sit at the table and enjoy for all eternity.”</p>
    <p>In the very last days of her life, one of my son-in-laws went to see her. She was bedridden by that time and could hardly speak, but with a low voice she said to him: “My son, how many times have you been told about Jesus? Consider that when He died on the cross, they placed a crown of thorns on His head; He did this for us sinners! Instead, if we are faithful to Him, He will give us a crown of gold!”</p>
    <p>Two days later, at the age of 95, the Lord called her to Him, and she was able to say: <BibleQuote>“I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing.” (2 Timothy 4:7, 8)</BibleQuote></p>
