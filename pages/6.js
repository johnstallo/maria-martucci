    <p>In 1947, after Gino's healing, my father converted to the gospel.</p>
    <p>My mother, as I have mentioned, always took the opportunity to hear the Word of God preached at the Baptist Church at Mottola whenever she went to visit her family. At that time there was not yet an established evangelical community at Massafra, so my mother asked the Baptist pastor to visit the believers of Massafra, to preach the message from the Word of God. My father, who was now a believer, no longer banned my mother from these things; on the contrary, he was eager himself to go to the church in Mottola to pray and listen to sermons with his wife. From time to time, then, the Baptist pastor visited our house meetings where he would speak of the Lord. In the same period, brother Michele Andrisani from Matera, and brother Raffaele Pignone from Bari, also began to visit us occasionally. They made themselves available to lead church service in our house.</p>
    <p>In 1947, the Lord gave my parents another daughter (much awaited by me): she was named Antonia Rosa and she was the first child not to be baptized as an infant.</p>
    <p>Our house consisted of just one room, five meters by five meters, but there was also a small atrium. My father managed to build out a kitchen there, as well as a bathtub that was later used for baptisms. Although it was a very small and crowded house, church meetings were held there.</p>
    <p>In the years 1949 and 1950, church brothers began to visit our house more assiduously, including brother Francesco Giancaspero, of the town of Triggiano, in the province of Bari. The room that my father had organized in the atrium served for those blessed church gatherings.</p>
    <p>I remember one episode in particular: a group of young Catholics, who came to know about the meetings being held in our house, one day pretended that they wanted to listen to the preaching of God’s Word with us. In reality, they came with the intention of mocking us evangelicals. A debate ensued, and the young group did not know how to respond to the believers’ words. Subsequently they sought to organize a meeting with the priests they trusted for all religious matters.</p>
    <p>So one day, we met with Father Isidoro. Among that young group of Catholic men was also a young man called Salvatore Convertino, who later became my husband. His search for the Lord was sincere, and during that meeting he prayed to God to give wisdom (“opening the mouth”, as he says) to the people on whose side the truth was. By the end of the meeting, his heart was fully convicted by the Word of God: the Lord showed him that Jesus is the Truth and that there was no more a reason to doubt. That day Salvatore was saved and joined us, and the group of Evangelicals grew the more.</p>
    <p>In that room the Lord also saved a man who was a carpenter: his name was Vito Ramunno. By the grace of God, this brother made about twenty wooden benches, which were used in our church meetings to accommodate the believers.</p>
    <p>After the meetings that same room would be divided in four by hanging sheets, and the wooden benches were arranged in the first quarter of the room, next to each other, so as to form a large bed where we placed mattresses on which slept three of my brothers. In another quarter of the room was the bed in which my parents slept; in the third quarter of the room, there were foldable cots where the little ones slept; and finally, the last quarter of the room was used as a dining room. I can say, however, that the Lord blessed this small house, and in it many souls were saved and baptized in the bathtub that my father had made.</p>
    <p>Not only was this room used for all these things, but also we frequently lodged brothers who visited us from other parts of Italy and from America. When the brothers could not come to preach, my father would lead our worship of God. Although he could not read well, he was guided by the Holy Spirit and souls were blessed, because the Lord was with us and sustained our simple faith in every way. It went on like this for several years.</p>
    <p>In 1951, my parents were able to afford a 150 square meter parcel of land to build a new, larger house. My father decided to utilize the largest room of the house for the work of God. In 1953 everything was completed with the help of the Lord, and our church meetings were held there until 1957. Later, the Lord provided the church of Massafra with a dedicated church property, in Via Paisiello.</p>
    <p>Brother Santoro, conferring with the church council, presented the necessity of buying land for building a church, because the Lord had saved many souls still, and our house was no longer sufficient to contain the number of believers. Three brothers, Pierino, Ettore and Antonio Ramunno, offered to erect the walls, and kept their commitment. Unfortunately, as their work ended we lacked the funds to construct the roof.</p>
    <p>My parents were in correspondence with some brothers in America, whom they had hosted time before. Salvatore Convertino, who was then my fiancé, with the permission of my parents wrote them a letter making known our needs. Thus, financial help arrived from America for the completion of the work of God, and our first church building finally opened its doors, with open access to anyone who wanted to enter and listen to the Word of the Lord.</p>
    <p>I am very attached to the memory of that place, both because of the great blessings that the Lord granted us, and because the first believers to celebrate their marriage ceremony there brother Convertino and I. Since, however, the religious ceremony was not recognized by the State, the day before we were married at the City Council, while the next day brother Sergio Zucchi (pastor of the Church of Via Emilia, Taranto) came to celebrate our marriage union before God.</p>
    <p>God’s work has continued until this day, and by His grace it was necessary to change church location yet again, because the Lord had saved so many souls.</p>
    <p>In 1954, the last child in our family was born, Elia, who together with his four brothers and two sisters, gave their hearts to the Lord and committed themselves to Christian service. Everything was done for the glory of God.</p>
