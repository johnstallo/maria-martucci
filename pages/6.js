    <p>And so in 1947, after Gino's healing, my father converted to the Gospel.</p>
    <p>My mother, as I have mentioned, always took the opportunity to hear the Word of God preached at the Baptist church at Mottola whenever she went to visit her family. At that time there was not yet an established evangelical community at Massafra, so my mother asked the Baptist pastor to visit the believers of Massafra, to preach from the Word of God. My father, who was now a believer, no longer prohibited my mother from these things; on the contrary, he was eager himself to go to the church in Mottola to pray and listen to sermons with his wife. From time to time, then, the Baptist pastor visited our house meetings where he would speak of the Lord. In the same period, brother Michele Andrisani from Matera, and brother Raffaele Pignone from Bari, also began to visit us occasionally. They made themselves available to lead church service in our house.</p>
    
    <p>In 1947, another daughter (much awaited by me) was born into our family: she was named Antonia Rosa and she was the first child not to receive infant baptism according to the Roman Catholic tradition.</p>

    <p>Our house consisted of just one room, about 16 feet by 16 feet, in which our family life took place. There was also a small atrium outside, and my father managed to build out a kitchen there covered by a canopy, and in the remaining enclosure he dug in the ground a tank for baptisms. Although it was a very small and crowded accommodation, we held church services there. During the baptismal services in the atrium, many curious neighbors and passers-by would look over the low atrium wall; some would even sit on the wall and watch the baptisms from beginning to end. Among these was Vito Ramunno and his wife Maria, who both converted to the Gospel; brother Vito was a carpenter and he built some twenty simple wooden benches without trellises on which we sat during service. After the meetings the same inner room was divided by curtains into four parts, and the same benches were placed in one quarter of a room, one next to the other, so as to form a large bed on which we placed mattresses for three of my brothers. In another quarter of the room was the bed in which my parents slept; in the third quarter, instead, there were some open and close camp beds where the little ones slept; finally, the last quarter of the room was used as a dining room. I can say, however, that this small house was so blessed by the Lord; many souls came to know Christ there, and were baptized in the tank that my father had built.</p>

    <p>Not only were all of these things done in that room, we also hosted traveling brothers who came from other parts of Italy and from America. When these brothers could not come to preach, my father would step in to lead our worship to God. Even though he could not read very well, he was led by the Holy Spirit and souls were blessed, because the Lord was with us and sustained our simple faith in every way. This went on for several years.</p>

    <p>In the years 1949 and 1950, church brothers began to visit our house more frequently, including brother Francesco Giancaspero, of the town of Triggiano, in the province of Bari.</p>

    <p>I remember one episode in particular: a group of young Catholics, who learned about the meetings being held in our house, one day pretended that they too wanted to listen to the preaching of God’s Word with us. In reality, they came with the clear intention to mock us evangelicals, and had come prepared with rocks in their hands to throw at us. But when the pastor began to read the Bible passage in Isaiah 40:3, <BibleQuote>A voice cries: “In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.”</BibleQuote>, one of those young men named Salvatore Convertino, recognized that what was being read was part of the Bible, and prevented the others from throwing stones.</p>
    
    <p>At the end of the meeting a debate ensued between the young Catholics and the believers, during which Salvatore accused my mother of not being coherent on the question of idols and statues, since on the dresser behind the pulpit there was a rag doll with which I played (I was about 9 years old). As the debate continued, the young Catholics found themselves unable to respond to the believers’ words, and they subsequently sought to organize a meeting to include their priest, in whom they trusted for all religious matters. When everyone had left, my mother threw away my rag doll so as to avoid any further misunderstandings, and I promised to myself that, if one day I had the opportunity, I would have thrown a rock right at that young man's head!</p>

    <p>One Sunday morning, they returned with their priest, Father Isidoro, and several monks and priests of various associations just at the time when our church service began. Brother Santoro (the first pastor of the church of Massafra) agreed to speak with them, but only after our church service would have ended. They accepted and joined us for the entire service. After service ended, the debate began and the young Catholic Salvatore stood up on a bench to more closely follow the discussion, as a large crowd had convened; he prayed in his heart the first spontaneous prayer of his life: “Lord, if the truth is on our side, then lead Father Isidoro in all that he says; otherwise, guide the words of this evangelical pastor, because I wish to serve You.” God began to speak to his heart and following this experience he began to read the Bible. Some time later he left for the military and converted to the Gospel.</p>
    
    <p>In 1958 Salvatore became my husband.</p>

    <p>In 1951, my parents were able to afford a 150 square meter parcel of land to build a new, larger house. My father decided to utilize the largest room of the house for the work of God. In 1953 everything was completed with the help of the Lord, and our church meetings were held there until 1957.</p>
    <p>Later, the Lord provided the church of Massafra with a dedicated church property, in Via Paisiello. Brother Santoro, conferring with the church council, presented the necessity of buying land for building a church, because the Lord had saved many souls still and our house was no longer sufficient to contain the number of believers. Three brothers, Pierino, Ettore and Antonio Ramunno, offered to erect the walls, and kept their commitment. Unfortunately, as their work ended, we lacked the funds to construct the roof.</p>
    <p>My parents were in correspondence with some brothers in America, whom they had hosted some time before. Salvatore Convertino, who was then my fiancé, with the permission of my parents wrote them a letter making known our needs. Thus, financial help arrived from America for the completion of the work of God, and our first church building finally opened its doors, with open access to anyone who wanted to enter and listen to the Word of the Lord.</p>
    <p>I feel very attached to the memory of that place, for the great blessings that the Lord granted us, and because my husband and I were the first believers to celebrate their marriage ceremony there. Since, however, the religious ceremony was not recognized by the State, the day before we were married at the City Council, while the next day brother Sergio Zucchi (pastor of the Church of Via Emilia, Taranto) came to celebrate our marriage union before God.</p>
    <p>God’s work has continued until this day, and by His grace it was necessary to change our church building location yet again, because the Lord had saved so many souls.</p>
    <p>In 1954, the last child in our family was born, Elia, who together with all his siblings, gave their hearts to the Lord and committed themselves to active Christian service.</p>
    <p>My mother would rejoice and give glory to God in seeing Donato, Antonio and Elia preach the Holy Word of God throughout Italy and abroad.</p>  
    <p>Everything was done for the glory of God.</p>
