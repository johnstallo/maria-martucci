    <p>In 1945 my mother gave birth to yet another son, whom she called Luigi (nicknamed Gino). Only a few months after birth, the baby developed a strong fever and became ill with meningitis.</p>
    <p>This terrible disease caused the baby’s neck to bend backward, so that the nape of his neck touched the back of his shoulders; to feed him, he had to be laid on his stomach.</p>
    <p>According to my father, and according to all of his side of the family and her side as well, who were all unbelievers, the cause of this curse was my mother, because she had converted to the Gospel. They insulted and humiliated her and even told her that Saint Cosimo (the patron of Massafra) was chastising her and her family because of her “new religion.”</p>
    <p>My maternal grandmother would say: “Maria, look in the mirror... do you not see how your face looks like that of the devil?!” My mother was shunned by her entire family.</p>
    <p>My father began to forbid her from attending Angela Maria's house, the only place where my mother could listen to the Word of God and to have an opportunity to pray with a few other evangelical believers.</p>
    <p>Instead of remonstrating, however, she continued to speak about Jesus; she would often say to my father, “Give your heart to Jesus as well, and you will see how wonderful it is. Listen to His Word and let us pray together, and He [Jesus] will operate.” But the more my mother would say these words the more my father would become infuriated, resulting in him reinforcing all the more his prohibition for her to attend Angela Maria’s house.</p>
    <p>But my mother continued to go in secret to Angela Maria to listen to the Word of God, and she always tried not to provide my father with an opportunity to get angry for the umpteenth time. To hide her absences, she always endeavored to organize lunch and all her chores with precision and perfectly on time (as my father continually sought the slightest excuse to attack her). The Lord, however, always protected her and blessed her with strength, calm, and wisdom in the manner in which she spoke and in all her doings. </p>
    <p>The entire neighborhood continued, however, to insult her, telling her repeatedly that her little boy was bearing the brunt of her sin, and who remained sick despite her faith. She remained undeterred and above all certain of being on the right path, God’s path, and she continued to testify how Jesus saves and heals.</p>
