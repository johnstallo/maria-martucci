    <p>One day my mother fell down the stairs and hurt her hand and arm. My father told her they should go to the hospital for x-rays, to see if there was any fracture. As usual, my mother refused to go for fear that they would give her medicine. Her arm and hand, of course, became swollen and blackened. She bandaged it and, being unable to leave her arm down hanging because of the pain, she tied a handkerchief around her neck to keep it up and bent.</p>
    <p>In those days, a cousin of my father’s came to visit us, who was a doctor by profession. He too was aware of my mother's testimony, but he said to her: “<i>Commare</i> [meaning <i>lady</i>, in a friendly sense] Maria, what happened to your arm?” My mother said, “I fell down the stairs head over heels! But thank God nothing serious happened.” The doctor asked her, “Who bandaged up your arm with that splint?” She replied, “I prayed to the Lord and I felt like I should do this! I am sure He has helped me but, in any case, His will be done.” The doctor examined her hand, which was all black and swollen, and said to her: “I recommend you go to the hospital for care, otherwise you run the risk of amputating your hand.”</p>
    <p>My mother replied, “The Lord can put bones back into place also. If His will is that I die, it is all right with me anyway, because I'll go to Him.” The doctor, baffled and perhaps a little annoyed, said: “Do as you wish,” and he left.</p>
    <p>After some time, my father's cousin returned again to visit them and asked, “Commare Maria, how is her hand?” And she, in a playful tone, replied, “Actually, I am unable to move it.” He said, “Didn't I tell you to have it treated? Let's hope it doesn't result in more problems now!”</p>
    <p>My mother, however, really could move her arm, and so she said: “Look how great the Lord is. This arm feels stronger than the other, even if you can tell where it was broken!” The doctor could do nothing but verify the healing of her arm, and concede that God is wonderfully great. “If you give your heart to the Lord and confess your sins, He can do these things for you too!” The doctor’s mother gave her heart to the Lord, she was baptized and now she is with Him in heaven. After that testimony of my mother, also the doctor’s aunt, along with her husband, were saved (for those who know them they are brother Quarata and his wife).</p>
    <p>How many great works the Lord has done all these years and how many people have given their heart to Him. Glory to God!</p>
