    <p>One day my mother fell down the stairs and hurt her hand and arm. My father told her that they should go to the hospital for x-rays, to see if there was any fracture. As usual, my mother refused to go for fear that they would give her medicine. Her arm and hand became swollen and blackened. She bandaged it and, being unable to lower her arm to her side because of the pain, she tied a large handkerchief around her neck and forearm to keep it raised and bent.</p>
    <p>In those days a cousin of my father came to visit us, who was a doctor by profession. He too was aware of my mother's testimony, but he said to her: “<i>Commare</i> [meaning <i>lady</i>, said in a friendly way] Maria, what happened to your arm?” My mother said, “I fell down the stairs head over heels! But thank God nothing serious happened.” The doctor asked her, “Who bandaged up your arm with that splint?” She replied, “I prayed to the Lord and I felt like I should do this! I am sure He has helped me, but in any case may His will be done.” The doctor examined her blackened and swollen hand and said to her: “I recommend you go to the hospital for care, otherwise you run the risk of amputating your hand.”</p>
    <p>My mother replied, “The Lord can put bones back into place also. If it is His will that I die, it is all right with me anyway, because I will go to Him.” The doctor, bewildered and perhaps a little annoyed, said: “Do as you wish,” and he left.</p>
    <p>After some time, my father's cousin returned again to visit them and asked, “Commare Maria, how is her hand?” She replied in a playful tone: “Actually, I am unable to move it!” He said, “Didn't I tell you to go and get it treated? Let's hope now that it doesn't lead to more problems!”</p>
    <p>My mother, however, really could move her arm, and she exclaimed: “Look how great the Lord is. This arm feels stronger than the other, even though you can still see where it was broken!” The doctor had no choice but to acknowledge that her arm was healed, and to concede that God indeed is wonderfully great. Even in this case she proclaimed the message of salvation in Jesus saying: “If you give your heart to the Lord and confess your sins, He can do these things for you too!” That doctor’s mother gave her heart to the Lord, she was baptized and she is now with Him in heaven. After that particular testimony of my mother, the doctor’s aunt and her husband were also saved (for those who know them they are brother Quarato and his wife).</p>
    <p>How many great works the Lord has done all these years and how many people have given their heart to Him! Mama had no exceptional abilities but was a simple instrument that the Great Teacher and Lord could use. She loved the Lord with all her heart and wished to speak about God's love to anyone she came across.</p>
    <p>Glory to God!</p>
