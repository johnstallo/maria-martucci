    <p>My mother would sit outside the front door when she was done with her housework or when it was hot. One day, while sitting there, she saw a young man stop by next door who then called out to the lady who lived there: “Peace!” Now, in her dialect, the word peace (pace) sounds similar to the word crazy (paccj). My mother did not clearly understand what the young man had meant. Puzzled, she turned to her mother-in-law who was sitting beside her and asked: “Mama, did you hear that young man? Did he say peace or crazy?”</p>
    <p>Her mother-in-law replied: “My daughter, you must have nothing to do with those people because they are excommunicated, and they do not love the saints!”</p>
    <p>However, my mother couldn’t get that word she had heard the young man say out of her head, be it peace or crazy. Intrigued, and secretly from her mother-in-law, she went to her neighbor for an explanation: “Excuse me, ma’am, that young man who greeted you the other day, did he say peace or crazy?”</p>
    <p>The lady answered in a quiet manner: “He said ‘Peace’!” Further intrigued, my mother asked what he had meant by using that word.</p>
    <p>The lady, who was very affable, told her that the young man was an evangelical, and that their greeting meant “peace to you”, the same greeting that Jesus used. The lady went on to tell her that the young evangelical had also gifted her a Bible (which is the testimony that Jesus left us), but that she never could read it for lack of time.</p>
    <p>My mother was illiterate, and so she said, “Ma’am, I can’t read, but you can. If you cannot find the time, let’s do this: I can clean your fava beans for you (that is, she had to shell dried fava beans) and you read, because I am very interested to know what is written in the Bible.”</p>
    <p>And so, Angela Maria (the lady's name) accepted the deal and began to read the Bible. This went on for a long time; they would read the Bible and then pray.</p>
    <p>The young man who had greeted Angela Maria with “peace” was called Paolo Spada, and he also being illiterate, began to listen to the Word of God with the two women, and then they would pray together. The Lord, consequently, began to bless them.</p>
    <p>In 1937, my mother gave birth to another son, whom she called Donato. At that time in Italy, the fascists began to persecute the Pentecostal evangelicals, but believers were also persecuted by the clergy. In Massafra, there was no Pentecostal church and the few evangelical believers there gathered in Angela Maria's house.</p>
    <p>My mother from time to time went to Mottola to visit her family. There was a Baptist church there, which she attended whenever she went to Mottola.</p>
    <p>Soon after, a preacher named Pola of Ginosa began to visit Massafra.</p>
    <p>One day as my mother was praying alone in her house, she began to feel a great joy within her: she felt the presence of God in her heart and she began to speak in other tongues; she did not understand what was happening to her, because she had never been told about the Holy Spirit. When she later met with her fellow believers to pray, the Holy Spirit manifested again, and my mother again began to speak in other tongues. Sister Angela Maria, who also did not know about the baptism of the Holy Spirit, thought this behavior “strange,” and that it was not of God.</p>
    <p>Several days later, the brother from Ginosa came to visit the believers in Massafra, and Angela Maria immediately referred to him what had happened to my mother during prayer. The sister said: “I don’t know, maybe it is some evil spirit and this thing is not of God.” The brother replied, “Don't worry, I'll examine the matter.”</p>
    <p>During prayer, my mother began to speak in tongues and there was a great manifestation of the Spirit of God. The brother then explained the bible passage of Pentecost and that this promise was not only for the disciples, but unto as many the Lord shall call (as it is written in Acts 2) and therefore added: “Sister Maria was baptized in the Holy Spirit!”</p>
    <p>During that time, my mother was also told about the baptism in water that is in obedience to Jesus’ command to go therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost (Matthew 28:19). My mother then decided and said, “I want to be baptized according to His command!” And so, sister Angela Maria’s bathtub was used as a baptistery, and as it is written that joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth (Luke 15:7) so there was great joy also on earth. Glory to God!</p>
    <p>In 1940, a daughter was born, Maria Annunziata (that is, me, Titina, as they always called me).</p>
    <p>During that time the Second World War was underway, and it was very difficult to find food, especially for the poorest families; we could buy only flour and other essential food items with food stamps distributed by the local government, and only a precise quantity based on the number of members in each household. Food was scarce, and we suffered hunger.</p>
    <p>In 1942 my mother gave birth to another son, whom she named Antonio; the family continued to grow, and food decreased more and more. My mother prayed to God to provide for them.</p>
    <p>I remember once... My brother Donato cried, “I’m hungry!” to which my mother replied: “The Lord shall provide, and we will eat.” At that reply, Donato exclaimed: “Then let’s pray to God!”</p>
    <p>So, we all prayed together, and soon after we heard a knock at the door. It was a neighbor, who said to my mother: “Maria, it was my daughter’s wedding yesterday, and many guests did not come. Many trays of oven-baked pasta, potatoes, and meat were left over, and I thought perhaps you wouldn't be offended if I brought some to you, since you have many children. If you like I will bring everything to you.”</p>
    <p>My mother not only accepted all the good that God had provided, she also told the woman of all that had happened and how the Lord had entered her heart, and then she thanked her.</p>
    <p>We really saw a miracle of God!</p>
